# MyD&D

I'm developing this website to fix some limitations I found with existing tools for Dungeons & Dragons. The websites I was using when running a campaign allowed users to view spells and other items, but not save them. They also didn't support creating a campaign or letting using share their notes. This site uses Ruby on Rails, with a combination of API queries and database storage, to build those features.

The site can be previewed here: https://my-dnd-production-4a62c2654ada.herokuapp.com/
Note: This is still in development. Some features are missing and the UI is likely to change in the future.
